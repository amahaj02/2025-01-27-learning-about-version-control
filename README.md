# Learning about Version Control

- Author : Aarav Mahajan

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What do I like most about version control : Version control gives a great "playground" that one can use for different purposes, from testing to developing packages or dashboards.

What do I find the most challenging thing about version control : Resolving merge conflicts when working with collaborators, especially if there is little communication.
